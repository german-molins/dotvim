While the motions f/F and t/T can be repeated with , and ; the default key mapping is not
only unintuitive it also requires the user to remember in what direction s/he moved with the previous f/t motion.

This nuisance brought me to rethink the idea of repeatable motions and resulted
in this plugin.

repeatable-motions.vim makes most default motions repeatable in an easy and
intuitive way. Perform a motion once (such as f) and repeat it simply with
<C-h> to the left and <C-l> to the right. The direction is always what you'd expect, no more remembering if you used f or F.

Additionally repeatable-motions.vim distinguishes between vertical and horizontal
motions. So [M can be repeated with <C-j> and <C-k> while still remembering your
previous horizontal movement.

Motions that are being repeated behave like normal motions, support counts and can be used in
operation-pending as well as visual-mode.

Everything works out of the box and making your own motion
repeatable is as easy as calling AddRepeatableMotion("<Up>", "<Down>", 1).
Buffer-, expression- and custom mappings are all handled without further ado.
